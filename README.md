# Rain_typing

This code allows for rain typing from radar images.

To run the code:
1) Put your data (radar images) in a \Data folder, or unzip the Data.zip file to use the test dataset. NB: The test dataset provided here is made of synthetic radar images.
2) Open the file 'script_segment_rain_events.m' and edit the parameters of the script (header of the file)
3) Run the file 'script_segment_rain_events.m' in Matlab.
